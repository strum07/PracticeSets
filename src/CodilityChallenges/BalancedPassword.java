// A string is balanced if it consists of exactly two different characters and both of those characters appear exactly the same number of times.

// For example: "aabbab" is balanced (both 'a' and 'b' occur three times) but "aabba" is not balanced ('a' occurs three times, 'b' occurs two times).

// String "aabbcc" is also not balanced (it contains three different letters).

// A substring of string S is a string that consists of consecutive letters in S. For example: "ompu" is a substring of "computer" but "cmptr" is not.

// Write a function solution that, given a string S, returns the length of the longest balanced substring of S.

// Examples:

// 1. Given S = "cabbacc", the function should return 4 ("abba" is the longest balanced substring).

// 2. Given S = "abababa", the function should return 6 ("ababab" and "bababa" are the longest balanced substrings).

// 3. Given S = "aaaaaaa", the function should return 0 (S does not contain a balanced substring).

// Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

// N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; - Never understood what 'N' is!

// String S consists only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z).
