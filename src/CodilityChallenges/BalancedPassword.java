//A string is balanced if it consists of exactly two different characters and both of those characters appear exactly the same number of times. 

//For example: "aabbab" is balanced (both 'a' and 'b' occur three times) but "aabba" is not balanced ('a' occurs three times, 'b' occurs two times). 

//String "aabbcc" is also not balanced (it contains three different letters).

//A substring of string S is a string that consists of consecutive letters in S. For example: "ompu" is a substring of "computer" but "cmptr" is not.

//Write a function solution that, given a string S, returns the length of the longest balanced substring of S.

//Examples:

//1. Given S = "cabbacc", the function should return 4 ("abba" is the longest balanced substring).

//2. Given S = "abababa", the function should return 6 ("ababab" and "bababa" are the longest balanced substrings).

//3. Given S = "aaaaaaa", the function should return 0 (S does not contain a balanced substring).

//Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

//N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; - Never understood what 'N' is!

//string S consists only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z).
