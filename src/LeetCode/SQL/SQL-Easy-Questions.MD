// 176. Second Highest Salary

// https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/description/

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. 
If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+



// Can use NOT IN instead of the < operator

select MAX(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
where Salary < (select MAX(Salary) from Employee);



// 182. Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+

For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+

Note: All emails are in lowercase.


SELECT Email
FROM Person 
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(Email)>1;

The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+

Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+





# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name as Customers from customers  
where Id not in(select CustomerId from Orders);
